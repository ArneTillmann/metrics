# Metric: Growth-Maturity-Decline

**Background:**
At the Open Source Summit North America, a group of around 8-12 people each agreed on the metrics important in the following scenarios.
For now, we will focus our conversation around these outcomes to further the conversation.
The two-hour session sparked great conversations but could not address all aspects.
We thank everyone who participated.

Below is the metric->signal->action chain for *Growth-Maturity-Decline*.

## Growth-Maturity-Decline: Metric -> Signal -> Action

### Value Accumulation
- Bug resolution: Somewhat similar to the patch speed above.  We could look at the total number of tickets closed out of all the tickets opened over a given time period.  We can also look at the "time-to-close", which is time since a bug is opened until it is closed.
- Patch speed: There can be two different data.  One is "review efficiency", which is the number of merged/abandoned changes out of all submitted patches over a given period.  The other is "time-to-merge", which is the time since a patch is submitted until this is merged/abandoned.
- *Why:*
    - (why these metrics were chosen is not yet documented)
- *Signals:*
    - Value Accumulation: higher velocity signals more value accumulated
- *Informs activity:*
    - (not discussed at OSSNA)
- *Potential positive or negative outcomes:*
    - (not discussed at OSSNA)

### Transparency
- Number of new developers: Number of new contributors (using appropriate userid) over a period (e.g. monthly, quarterly, etc.)
- *Why:*
    - (why these metrics were chosen is not yet documented)
- *Signals:*
    - more people on the project might signal more transparency
    - More transparency might be positive
- *Informs activity:*
    - (not discussed at OSSNA)
- *Potential positive or negative outcomes:*
    - (not discussed at OSSNA)

### Downstream usage
- Trajectory of usage (e.g. OpenSSL high usage was not indicative)
- *Why:*
    - (why these metrics were chosen is not yet documented)
- *Signals:*
    - More downstream usage might be good
- *Informs activity:*
    - (not discussed at OSSNA)
- *Potential positive or negative outcomes:*
    - (not discussed at OSSNA)
